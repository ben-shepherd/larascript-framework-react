                <h2>What We'll Build</h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to create a backend API that supports common blog functionalities, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts</li>
                    <li>Managing user authentication and authorization</li>
                    <li>Handling comments on blog posts</li>
                    <li>Implementing basic search functionality</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We'll use Larascript, a powerful and expressive framework, to build our API. Larascript combines the elegance of Laravel's structure with the flexibility of JavaScript, making it an excellent choice for rapid API development.

                <h2>Quick Setup (~5 minutes)</h2>
                <p>Follow these steps to quickly set up your project:</p>

                <h3>1. Create a new repository</h3>
                <p>
                    Use the following link to create a new repository with Larascript as the template:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/new?template_name=larascript-framework&template_owner=ben-shepherd">
                        https://github.com/new?template_name=larascript-framework&template_owner=ben-shepherd
                    </a>
                </p>

                <h3>2. Install dependencies</h3>
                <p>Once you've cloned your new repository, run the following command in your project directory:</p>
                <pre><code>yarn install</code></pre>
                <p>This will install all the necessary dependencies for your project.</p>

                <h3>3. Start Database Containers</h3>
                <p>To set up your database environment, run:</p>
                <pre><code>yarn db:up</code></pre>
                <p>This command will start the necessary database containers for your project.</p>

                <h3>4. Run the setup command (optional)</h3>
                <p>If you want to populate the .env file with configured settings, use:</p>
                <pre><code>yarn setup</code></pre>
                <p>This step is optional but can be helpful for quickly configuring your environment.</p>

                <h3>5. Run database migrations</h3>
                <p>To set up your database schema, run:</p>
                <pre><code>yarn dev migrate:up</code></pre>
                <p>This command will apply all pending database migrations.</p>

                <h3>6. Start developing</h3>
                <p>To start your development server, use:</p>
                <pre><code>yarn dev</code></pre>
                <p>This will launch your application in development mode.</p>
